The latest HEMTT release can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/brettmayson/HEMTT/releases).

Extract the exe and place it in this folder, make sure that you name it `hemtt.exe`. If you are on Windows then this is the default, if you are on Linux then you will need to add the `.exe` extention.
