# hemtt todo
- github action for builds
  - can it do tests?
  - can it do releases for us?
- figure out how hemtt puts verions into the pbo and get it to do that automatically?
- PBOs get a prefix added to them
  - kind of breaks the sc_uniforms patch and the SEC_Guest pack
  - we also get warned that PBO names should be lowercase
- Build scripts might not support hemtt on linux anymore
