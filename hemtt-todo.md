# hemtt todo
- github action for builds
  - can it do tests?
  - can it do releases for us?
- figure out how hemtt puts verions into the pbo and get it to do that automatically?
  - https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/blob/v3.19.0/.hemtt/hooks/pre_build/01_set_version.rhai
  - Could also do with a bot to remind us to bump the version
- PBOs get a prefix added to them
  - kind of breaks the sc_uniforms patch and the SEC_Guest pack
- Build scripts might not support hemtt on linux anymore
