## Setting up Visual Studio Code
Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following addons:
* [EditorConfig.EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [vlad333000.sqf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vlad333000.sqf)

If you install the [Git command line](https://git-scm.com/downloads) then you can commit changes in the editor.

Alternatively, you can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and use it separately.

## Git LFS
This repo requires Git LFS.

Search online for how to install Git Large File System for your OS. It might be as simple as `git lfs install`, if you are using a GUI then it may install it for you automatically.
